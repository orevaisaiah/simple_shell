ALX Simple Shell Team Project

This is an ALX collaboration project on Shell. We were tasked to create a simple shell that mimics the Bash shell.

Description:

In this project we are tasked with creating our own simple UNIX command interpreter. 
The program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output. 
The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your argv[0].
